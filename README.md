# Econometrics-Min-Wage-Employment-DiD

##Overview

In this project I created a difference-in-difference model to identify the effect of minimum wage increase in New Jersey. This model captures the causal effect of the minimum wage increase on employment by comparing changes in employment over time between the treatment group (New Jersey) and the control group (Pennsylvania).
